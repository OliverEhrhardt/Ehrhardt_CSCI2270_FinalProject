# Ehrhardt_CSCI2270_FinalProject
Summary:
Final Project for CSCI2270 Data structures. This project impliments a library to tackle string minipulation. Basically it includes functions that would handle string inputs either, through minipulation of individual strings to orginizing strings in various data structures. Features include string sorting, compairing, and structure building will be included as well as any other useful functions that pertains to doing anything with a string. This libaray should would be implimented as a static C++ Library. Data structure implimentations may include Red-Black Trees and Hash Tables. Some features that would be implimented would be things such as ascending and decending alphebetical sorting, string compairing, and low cost string searching. Another feature that might no be implimented is a Trie data struture, whichi is a lot like a BST but evaluating the chars of each string instead.

How to use:
for easy implimentation, just download the zip file (StringSorter.zip) from git hub (click on it and then hit view raw) and unzip the file into your project. For directions on use, open the StringSorter directory and open the "main.cpp" driver file. To run, simply type in the terminal "g++ your_file.cpp StringSorter.cpp StringHash.cpp StringTree.cpp -o executableName" where your_file.cpp is the main function you are trying to exicute these files in and executableName is the name of the executable

Dependencies:
Right now the only dependencies is c++11 and ability to use string and vector libraries

System Requirments:
No requirements.

Group Members:
none

Open Issues:
There seems to be some compilation errors but I have not experienced them myself.
