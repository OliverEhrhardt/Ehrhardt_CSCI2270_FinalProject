# Ehrhardt_CSCI2270_FinalProject
Summary:
Final Project for CSCI2270 Data structures. This project impliments a library to tackle string minipulation. Basically it includes functions that would handle string inputs either, through minipulation of individual strings to orginizing strings in various data structures. Features include string sorting, compairing, and structure building will be included as well as any other useful functions that pertains to doing anything with a string. This libaray should would be implimented as a static C++ Library. Data structure implimentations may include Red-Black Trees, linked lists, stacks. Some features that would be implimented would be things such as ascending and decending alphebetical sorting, string compairing, and low cost string searching. One feature that might not go into this project would be a string definer, where whatever string inputed will be searched and then an appropriate definition is provided. This feature would require an internet connection.
