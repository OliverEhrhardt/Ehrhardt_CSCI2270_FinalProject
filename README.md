# Ehrhardt_CSCI2270_FinalProject
Summary:
Final Project for CSCI2270 Data structures. This project impliments a library to tackle string minipulation. Basically it includes functions that would handle string inputs either, through minipulation of individual strings to orginizing strings in various data structures. Features include string sorting, compairing, and structure building. Data structure implimentations  include Red-Black Trees and Hash Tables.

How to use:
for easy implimentation, just download the zip file (StringSorter.zip) from git hub (click on it and then hit view raw) and unzip the file into your project. For directions on use, open the StringSorter directory and open the "main.cpp" driver file. To run, simply run the terminal, navigate to the directory where you extracted the zip file, then type: "g++ -std=c++11 your_file.cpp StringSorter.cpp StringHash.cpp StringTree.cpp -o executableName" where your_file.cpp is the main function you are trying to exicute these files in and executableName is the name of the executable. Make sure that the directory that you run this command in also includes "StringSorter.h", "StringHash.h", and "StringTree.h" as well as the corrisponding .cpp files.

Dependencies:
Right now the only dependencies is c++11 and ability to use string and vector libraries

System Requirments:
No requirements.

Group Members:
none

Open Issues:
There seems to be some compilation errors but I have not experienced them myself.
